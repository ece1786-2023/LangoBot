            "- \"I wants\" instead of \"I want\"\n",
            "- \"it’s buildings beautiful\" instead of \"its buildings are beautiful\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Grammar errors explanation:\n",
            "- \"I wants\" is incorrect because when we use the verb \"want\", we don't add an 's' after the verb when the subject is \"I\". The correct phrase would be \"I want\". 'Wants' is commonly used when the subject is a third person singular, like he, she, or it. For example, \"He wants a new car.\" But when talking about yourself, you should say, \"I want.\"\n",
            "- \"it’s buildings beautiful\" needs to be corrected to \"its buildings are beautiful\". In English, we need a verb to connect the subject and the object. Here, the subject is \"buildings\" and the object is \"beautiful\", so the verb 'are' should be used to connect them. \"Are\" is used when the subject is plural, such as \"The buildings are beautiful.\" If the subject is a singular noun or pronoun, like \"it\" or \"the building\", we use 'is\", such as \"The building is beautiful.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "3. You did answer the question. You expressed your desired travel destination and a reason why you want to go there, which is great. However, to correct your response, you could say: \"I want to go to Paris because its buildings are beautiful.\" That makes perfect sense and it's grammatically correct! Keep up the good work, we're making progress on correct verb usage.\n",
            "1. There are two grammar errors in the student's response. \"Me\" should be replaced with \"I\" and \"cause\" should be replaced with \"because\".\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Firstly, instead of saying \"Me would like to\", you should say \"I would like to\". In English, we use \"I\" as the subject of a verb, for example, \"I eat\", \"I am\", \"I do\". \"Me\" is used as the object, for example, \"Give it to me\", \"Tell me\", \"He called me\".\n",
            "Secondly, \"because\" is the correct word to use instead of \"cause\". It's often used to explain reasons or causes. While \"cause\" can be used informally, in formal or academic writing or speaking, \"because\" should be used. For example, \"I go shopping because I need groceries.\" \"I am tired because I didn't sleep well.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "3. You did answer the question as you stated where you want to travel and why. Your corrected response could be: \"I would like to travel to Brazil because of the beaches.\"\n",
            "1. The student has made a grammar error in their response.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The student has misused the word 'are' where 'is' would be more grammatically correct. In this context, 'expertise' is an uncountable noun that refers to skill or knowledge in a particular area and 'is' should be used instead. \n",
            "\n",
            "- You use 'is' when the noun is singular or when it is an uncountable noun, such as water, information or expertise. Whereas, 'are' is used when the noun is plural.\n",
            "For example:\n",
            "  - The water is cold (not \"The water are cold\")\n",
            "  - My area of expertise is cooking (not \"My area of expertise are cooking\")\n",
            "\n",
            "   Here is another example that shows the correct use of 'is' and 'are':\n",
            "   - Alex is an engineer. (Not \"Alex are an engineer.\")\n",
            "   - Alex and John are friends. (Not \"Alex and John is friends.\")\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The student did answer the question, but the sentence construction was wrong. Here is a corrected and better version: \"My expertise is in cooking and baking, especially cakes.\"\n",
            "1. The sentence contains grammar errors. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. The student used \"My\" instead of \"I\" at the beginning of their sentence. In English, when talking about personal experiences or feelings, we use 'I', not 'My'. 'My' is a possessive pronoun and is used to show ownership to something (e.g., my book, my idea), while we use 'I' when we are the subject of a sentence or a clause.\n",
            "- Example with 'my': This is my book.\n",
            "- Example with 'I': I am reading a book.\n",
            "In the student's sentence, \"My have lots of experience in psychology\", the correct pronoun should be 'I', not 'my'. \n",
            "\n",
            "Also, the student should have used 'have' (the base form of 'have') and not 'has' (the third person singular of 'have') in this sentence. The rule is to use 'have' with 'I', 'you', 'we', 'they' and 'has' with 'he', 'she', 'it', and any singular noun.\n",
            "- Example with 'have': They have a new car.\n",
            "- Example with 'has': He has a new car.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. While the student attempts to answer the question, they misuse 'My' and 'have'. A better version of the student's response could be, \"I have a lot of experience in psychology.”\n",
            "1. The sentence has a grammar error.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The error in this sentence involves the incorrect use of the verb \"are\" after \"My hobby\". The correct verb in this case is \"is\" because \"My hobby\" is singular. \n",
            "\n",
            "    - As a rule of thumb, verbs in English need to agree with the subject in a sentence in terms of number. When you are talking about only one thing or person (i.e., a singular subject), you should use \"is\". For example, you could say \"my friend is playing the guitar\" or \"my mother is cooking\".\n",
            "    - However, if you are talking about more than one thing or person (i.e., a plural subject), you should use \"are\". For example, you could say \"my friends are playing the guitar\" or \"my parents are cooking\". \n",
            "\n",
            "3. The student does answer the question, but needs to improve the grammar to make the sentence clearer. A better way to phrase their hobbies could be: \"My hobbies are playing the guitar and cooking.\"\n",
            "1. The grammar errors in the sentence are:\n",
            "   a. \"I enjoying\" should be \"I enjoy\"\n",
            "   b. \"travel\" should be \"traveling\"\n",
            "   c. \"watch\" should be \"watching\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Let's focus on the corrections:\n",
            "\n",
            "   a. The phrase \"I enjoying\" is incorrect because the base form of the verb (enjoy) must follow the subject (I). The appropriate form that corresponds with \"I\" is \"I enjoy\". Remember that we use 'I enjoy', 'You enjoy', 'We enjoy', 'They enjoy' but 'He enjoys', 'She enjoys', 'It enjoys'.\n",
            "\n",
            "   Examples: \n",
            "   - I enjoy playing chess.\n",
            "   - She enjoys playing chess.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   b & c. The words 'travel' and 'watch' need to be in the gerund form ('traveling' and 'watching') because they follow a verbs 'enjoy'. In English, if a verb directly follows another verb the second verb is usually in gerund form, which means it ends with '-ing'.\n",
            "\n",
            "   Examples: \n",
            "   - I enjoy reading books.\n",
            "   - They enjoy traveling around the world.\n",
            " \n",
            "3. Despite the grammar errors, you did answer the question about your hobbies. Here's a corrected and better version of your response: \"I enjoy traveling to different countries and watching TV.\" Keep up the good work, with more practice your command over the language will get better!\n",
            "1. The grammar errors are in the words \"musics\" and \"enjoys\". \n",
            "2. Let's start with the word \"musics\". Music is an uncountable noun in English, meaning it does not have a plural form. Similarly to words like furniture or advice. So, instead of saying \"pop musics\", we just say \"pop music\".\n",
            "Next, I see the word \"enjoys\" is used incorrectly. \"Enjoy\" is a verb, and when referring to yourself, you would use \"enjoy\", not \"enjoys\". \"Enjoys\" is used when you're referring to he, she, or it. For example, \"He enjoys pop music\". When referring to yourself, or I, you would say \"I enjoy pop music\". Remember, we use 'I enjoy', 'you enjoy', 'we enjoy', 'they enjoy' but 'he enjoys', 'she enjoys', 'it enjoys'.\n",
            "3. You answered the question about your favourite kind of music, which is great! The correct and better version would be: \"Pop music is what I enjoy the most.\" Keep up practicing. With time, you'll get better.\n",
            "1. The sentences contains two grammar errors.\n",
            "2. The first error lies in the phrase \"Classical music make.\" The correct form should be \"makes,\" because when we are speaking about a single thing or person (in this case, 'classical music', which is a singular form despite referring to a type of music), we use 'makes' instead of 'make.' For example, you could say, \"Pop music makes me want to dance.\" On the other hand, if you are speaking about more than one thing or person, you would use 'make.' For example, \"Different genres make people feel different emotions.\"\n",
            "   The second error is in the phrase \"feel relax.\" The correct term should be \"feel relaxed\". Here, 'relaxed' is an adjective that describes a state of being. For example, \"I feel relaxed after a hot bath.\" In contrast, 'relax' is a verb, used when you need to describe the action of becoming more relaxed. For example, \"I want to relax in a hot bath.\"\n",
            "3. Yes, the student answers the question, but it would be better if they correct the mistakes. A better version of the sentence would be: \"Classical music makes me feel relaxed and calm.\"\n",
            "1. The grammar error in this sentence is the use of 'loves' instead of 'love'.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. 'Loves' is the third person singular present tense of the verb 'to love', meaning it is habitually used with singular third person pronouns or nouns (he, she, it). Correct examples would be 'She loves Chinese cuisine' or 'My brother loves Chinese cuisine.' In the first person, however, the appropriate verb form to use is 'love'. For example, 'I love Chinese cuisine' or 'We love Chinese cuisine.'\n",

            "1. The errors in this sentence include: incorrect ordering of pronouns (\"Me and my friends\") and missing the word 'to' before 'go.'\n",
            "   \n",
            "2. Let's look at the grammar errors:\n",
            "   \n",
            "- You used \"Me and my friends…\" in your response, but a better way to phrase this, is: \"My friends and I…\". The reason for this is that 'I' is a subject pronoun and 'me' is an object pronoun. 'I' is used when the person speaking is doing the action, e.g., \"I am reading a book\". On the other hand, 'me' is used when the action is being done to the person speaking, e.g., \"He gave the book to me.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "- Additionally, in your sentence, you left out the word 'to' before the verb 'go'. The verb 'to plan' is often followed by an infinitive ('to' + base form of the verb), so we say 'plan to go,' not 'plan go'. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. Your answer does respond to the question properly, though it could be improved with the corrections above. A more complete and corrected version could be: \"My friends and I are planning to go to a concert.\"\n",
            "1. The student made a grammar error in this sentence.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The grammar mistake in the sentence is the incorrect verb form \"I playing\". In English, when we are talking about future plans we use the present continuous tense. The correct formation of present continuous tense \"I am playing\" or we can use \"I will\" or \"I'm going to\".\n",
            "\n",
            "- \"I am\" is used when the subject of the sentence is \"I\". \"Am\" is used only with the pronoun \"I\". For example: \"I am going to the supermarket.\"\n",
            "- \"Is\" is used when the subject of the sentence is a singular noun or he, she or it. For example: \"She is playing basketball.\" \"The dog is playing with the ball.\"\n",
            "- Simple future tense can also be used for future plans. \"Will\" is used with all pronouns. For example: \"I will play basketball tomorrow.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Yes, the student does answer the question - though the grammar is not correct. A better version of student response would be: \"This weekend, I am playing badminton with my classmates\" or \"I'm going to play badminton with my classmates this weekend.\"\n",
            "1. The grammar error in the sentence is the missing article 'a' before 'sad story'. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. The student has missed using the indefinite article 'a' before 'sad story'. An article is a word used before a noun to indicate whether the noun is being used in a particular or general sense. In English, the indefinite articles are 'a' and 'an', used before words that refer to any member of a group or type of thing. For example, 'a cat', 'an apple', 'a car'. The definite article 'the' is used to refer to a specific member or instance of a group. For example, 'The cat is on the mat.' In your sentence, you need an indefinite article 'a' before 'sad story' because you're not referring to a specific sad story, but rather any sad story. \n",
            "\n",
            "Example with 'a': \"I have a dog.\"\n",
            "Example with 'the': \"The dog is outside.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Yes, you answered the question which was asking for your favorite movie. A better and corrected response would be: \"I liked 'Titanic' because it's a sad story.\"\n",
            "1. The grammar error in the sentence is the use of \"watches\" instead of \"watch\".\n",
            "\n",
            "2. You've made a small mistake in verb conjugation. The verb \"watches\" is third person singular form and it's used when the subject is he, she or it. For instance: 'He watches soccer every weekend'. But when you're referring to yourself using \"I\", the verb 'watch' should be used. For instance: 'I watch the news every morning'. \n",
            "\n",
            "3. You did answer the question, your favorite movie is \"Harry Potter\". A corrected version of your response would be: \"I like 'Harry Potter' and I watch them often.\" As an advanced way to express the same thought, consider saying: \"My favorite movie is 'Harry Potter' which I frequently watch.\"\n",
            "1. The student made an error in the sentence structure.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The phrase 'I have studied' is more used when one is currently studying or recently finished studying. However, given the context, it is likely they already finished, so the appropriate phrase would be 'I studied'. In English, 'have studied' is used when the action started in the past and continues to the present or its effects still relate to the present moment. 'Studied' is used when the action started and finished in the past.\n",
            "    - Examples for 'studied': 'I studied French in high school.', 'She studied at Oxford University.'\n",
            "    - Examples for 'have studied': 'I have studied English for many years now.', 'They have studied the effects of this medicine on patients.'\n",
            "\n",
            "3. The student does answer the question about where they went to school. A corrected and improved version of the student's response could be: \"I studied anthropology at the University of Chicago.\"\n",
            "1. The errors in the response are in the use of the present perfect tense 'have gone' and the preposition 'for' before 'studied'.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Grammar Errors:\n",
            "- The usage of 'have gone' implies that the action is still relevant to the present time or has impact on the present, but when you're speaking about studying somewhere in the past, it is more correct to use the simple past 'went'. For example: \n",
            "Misused: \"I have gone to the cinema yesterday.\"\n",
            "Correct: \"I went to the cinema yesterday.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "- The second issue is with the use of the preposition 'for' before 'studied'. In this context, you should use 'to' in place of 'for', and follow it by the infinitive form 'study', not the past 'studied'.\n",
            "Misused: \"I went to school for studied physics.\"\n",
            "Correct: \"I went to school to study physics.\"\n",
            " \n",
            "3. Your response does answer the question, but it could be more grammatically accurate. A corrected version could be: \"I went to school at Stanford to study physics.\"\n"

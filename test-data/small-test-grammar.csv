Where did you go to school?,"I was educated at the UBC, where I pursued a degree in Statistics.",0,,"The student's response is grammatically correct, there are no spelling errors, and it appropriately answers the question.

The student perfectly answers the question by providing the name of the educational institution and the field of study. A possible enhancement could involve providing more detail or specifics about their experience there, but this isn't strictly necessary. Here is an example of a revised response:

Where do you want to travel to and why?,I wants to go to Paris because its buildings beautiful.,2,Verb agreement error ('wants' should be 'want'); missing word error in 'it’s buildings beautiful' (should be 'its buildings are beautiful'),"There are a few errors in your sentence:
1. Mistaken form of verb ""want"" - You should use 'want' instead of 'wants' when the subject is 'I'.
2. Missing ""are"" after ""its buildings"" to make a complete sentence.
3. Incorrect use of the pronoun 'its'. The correct word to use is 'it's' (it is).

Grammar rule explanations:
1. Verbs generally add 's' in present simple tense third person singular (he, she, it), but 'I' uses the base form of the verb. For instance ""I want"" not ""I wants"".
2. 'Are' in context refers to the state of being of the buildings. E.g. Those buildings are beautiful.
3. 'It's' is a contraction of 'it is' or 'it has'. 'Its' is a possessive pronoun, meaning belonging to it. For instance, 'it's a beautiful day' versus 'every dog has its day'.

You answered the question well. Here's the suggested version of your sentence: I want to go to Paris because its buildings are beautiful.",3,0,0.67
Where do you want to travel to and why?,Me would like to travel to Brazil cause of the beaches.,2,Incorrect pronoun usage ('Me' should be 'I'); informal contraction ('cause' should be 'because'),"1. The student's response contains two grammar errors: ""Me would"" should be ""I would"", and ""cause"" should be ""because"".

2. The grammar errors can be explained as follows:

   - ""Me would"": The correct word to use here is 'I'. 'I' is used as the subject of a sentence, while 'me' is often used as an Object. For instance, you would say, ""I want to eat ice cream,"" but ""Can you give me the ice cream?"" In your sentence, 'I' should have been used because you're expressing a personal desire or intent. 

   Another example could be: 'I am going to the park.' We cannot say 'Me am going to the park.' It is grammatically incorrect.

   - ""cause"": 'Because' should be used to provide a reason for something. 'Cause' is more colloquial and informal, while 'because' is more formal and universally accepted in both spoken and written English. In fact, 'cause' is a short form of 'because,' used informally or in speech.
   
   A correct usage of both words might be: 
   'I am late because I missed the bus.' We wouldn't say 'I am late cause I missed the bus.' in formal or academic writing.

3. The student does answer the question, albeit with errors. 

   The corrected sentence could be: 
   ""I would like to travel to Brazil because of the beaches.""",5,1,1
What's your area of expertise?,"My expertise are in cooking and baking, especially cakes.",1,Subject-verb agreement error ('are' should be 'is'),"1. The sentence has a grammatical error.

2. The phrase 'My expertise are in...' is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase would be 'My Expertise is in...'. This is because 'expertise' is an uncountable noun, meaning it doesn't have a plural form and is therefore treated as a singular noun. 

For example, we say, 'The furniture is beautiful' not 'The furniture are beautiful'. 

However, when we talk about individual items within an uncountable noun, we can use 'are'. For instance, 'The chairs in the room are comfortable.' 

There are some nouns that are always plural, such as 'people' or 'scissors', where we use 'are'. Like, 'The scissors are over here.'

3. The student's answer perfectly addresses the question about his/her area of expertise. However, to correct the sentence, it should be: 'My expertise is in cooking and baking, especially cakes.'",6,1,1
What's your area of expertise?,My have lots of experience in psychology.,1,Incorrect pronoun usage ('my' should be 'I'),"1. Grammar errors identified in your response: 
- The use of ""My"" instead of ""I"" at the beginning of the sentence.

2. Grammar error explanation: 
- You used ""My"" instead of ""I"". In English, ""My"" is a possessive pronoun used to indicate ownership or relation. So, we use ""My"" when we're talking about something that belongs to us, like ""my book"" or ""my opinion."" ""I"", on the other hand, is a personal pronoun that we use when we're talking about ourselves. For example, ""I am studying"" or ""I have done the homework"".
- Let's look at some correct examples for each word:
  a) Correct examples for ""My"": ""My specialty is psychology"" or ""My work primarily involves psychology"".
  b) Correct examples for ""I"": ""I have a lot of experience in psychology"" or ""I specialize in psychology"".

3. The student's response does answer the question, but it contains grammatical mistakes. The corrected version of the sentence would be: ""I have lots of experience in psychology.""",6,1,1
What are your hobbies?,My hobby are playing the guitar and cooking foods.,2,Subject-verb agreement error ('are' should be 'is'); uncountable noun ('foods' should be 'food'),"1. The grammar mistakes present are the use of ""are"" instead of ""is"" after ""My hobby"" and the use of ""foods"" instead of ""food"".

2. The proper phrase might be ""My hobbies are"" or ""My hobby is"", depending on the context. Essentially, if we are talking about one hobby, we say, ""My hobby is"". But when talking about multiple hobbies, we say, ""My hobbies are"". In your case, since you mentioned two hobbies, the correct form is ""My hobbies are"". It's crucial to align the subject-verb agreement properly. For example, we say ""He is playing the guitar"" but ""They are playing the guitars"". Another error is the use of ""foods"" which should be ""food"". In English, we generally use the word ""food"" in singular form when talking about it in general. 

3. Yes, you did answer the question as you stated your hobbies. Here is the corrected version of your sentence:

""My hobbies are playing the guitar and cooking food."" Or if you choose to only mention one, you should say ""My hobby is playing the guitar."" or ""My hobby is cooking food.""",5.5,0,0.5
What are your hobbies?,I enjoying travel to different countries and watch TV.,2,"Present tense ('enjoying' should be 'enjoy'); verb (enjoy) + ing ('travel' should be 'travelling', 'watch' should be 'watching')","1. The errors lie in the usage of verbs in your sentence.

2. In English, we need to use the correct form of verb depending on the subject. Here, the verb is 'enjoy' and 'watch'. The first phrase ""I enjoying travel"" should be 'I enjoy travelling.' 'Enjoying' is a present participle and is used in continuous forms. Here, though, the correct form to use with 'I' is 'enjoy.' Similarly, we should say 'I watch.' instead of 'watch'. 

Just for further clarification, we say 'I am enjoying' and 'I am watching' when an action is taking place currently. For example, ""I am enjoying my lunch,"" ""I am watching TV.""

We say 'I enjoy' and 'I watch' when an action happens regularly or as a preference. For example, ""I enjoy playing soccer,"" ""I watch movies during the weekend.""

3. Yes, you did answer the question – I now know that you like travelling and watching TV. However, let's correct your sentence. It should read: ""I enjoy travelling to different countries and watching TV.""",2,0,0.67
Of course! Let's talk about music. What kind of music do you enjoy listening to?,Pop musics is what I enjoys the most.,2,Plural form error ('musics' should be 'music'); subject-verb agreement error ('enjoys' should be 'enjoy'),"1. There are a few grammar errors in this sentence. 

- ""musics"" should be ""music""
- ""is"" should be ""are""
- ""enjoys"" should be ""enjoy""

2. Let's dive into the grammar errors:

- ""Musics"" is incorrect because ""music"" is an uncountable noun, which means it does not have a plural form. Uncountable nouns are things we usually conceptualize as whole or mass items rather than counting individual units, like water, art, love, or music. 

- ""is"" is a singular verb used when referring to a singular subject, like 'he', 'she' or 'it'. However, when using 'is,' the main subject your sentence was the noun phrase ""pop music,"" which is singular. We would usually say ""Pop music is what I enjoy the most.""

- ""Enjoys"" is incorrect in this context because you should use ""enjoy"" with ""I"". ""Enjoys"" is used when the subject is a singular noun or a third person singular pronoun like 'he', 'she', or 'it'. For example, ""She enjoys pop music.""

Here are some examples of correct usage:

- For ""music"": ""I love to listen to music."" (not musics)
- For ""is"": ""The book is on the table."" 
- For ""enjoy"": ""I enjoy playing football."" 

3. You definitely answered the question well by stating the type of music you enjoy listening to! Now, let's put everything together and correct your sentence:

""Pop music is what I enjoy the most.""

Keep practicing and you will get the hang of these rules in no time!",4,0,0.67
Of course! Let's talk about music. What kind of music do you enjoy listening to?,Classical music make me feel relax and calm.,2,Verb form error ('make' should be 'makes'); adjective form error ('relax' should be 'relaxed'),"1. The grammar errors included are:
    - The use of ""make"" instead of ""makes""
    - The use of ""relax"" instead of ""relaxed""

2. In your sentence, you've used the verb ""make"" which is not suitable in this context. When we are talking about a singular noun, such as 'classical music', we should use 'makes'. The verb ""make"" is commonly used when we refer to more than one item (plural). For example, we say ""Cats make me happy"", but when talking about one thing, like 'music' or 'a song', we say ""This song makes me happy.""
   Additionally, when you're describing how something makes you feel, the adjective form of the word is generally used after the verb ""feel"". In this case, you should use ""relaxed"" instead of ""relax"". We say 'I feel relaxed', not 'I feel relax'.
   Examples:
   - The warm sunshine makes me feel relaxed.
   - Slow songs make me feel melancholic.
   - Loud noises make me feel anxious.

3. Yes, you have answered the question of what kind of music you enjoy listening to. Your response could be better framed as, ""Classical music makes me feel relaxed and calm.""",6,1,1
"Okay, let's talk about food! What is your favorite cuisine or dish?",I loves Chinese cuisine.,1,Grammatical Errors:Subject-verb agreement error ('loves' should be 'love'),"1. Grammar error identified in the student's response: the student incorrectly used ""loves"" instead of ""love"".

2. As for using ""loves"" instead of ""love"", the verb ""love"" needs to match with the subject ""I"" in terms of number. The verb ""loves"" is a singular form typically used when the subject is ""he"", ""she"", or ""it"". For instance, we say ""He loves Chinese cuisine."" On the other hand, ""I"", ""you"", ""we"", and ""they"" are followed by ""love"". For example, ""I love music."", ""We love traveling."", ""You love playing basketball"", and ""They love studying different cultures.""

3. The student indeed answered the question, expressing preference for Chinese cuisine. However, the sentence structure he used was incorrect due to the verb-subject agreement error.
A better version of response could be: ""I love Chinese cuisine.""",6,1,1
"Okay, let's talk about food! What is your favorite cuisine or dish?","For me, French cooking have a unique elegance.",1,Subject-verb agreement error ('have' should be 'has'),"1. The student made a grammar error in their sentence. 

2. The grammar error comes from the misuse of 'have'. In this case, 'has' should be used instead of 'have'. 

'Have' is used when the subject of the sentence is in the first person plural (we), second person (you) - whether singular or plural -, and third person plural (they). For example:
- We have a big house.
- You have a nice smile.
- They have two pets.

'Has' is used for third person singular subjects like he, she, it, or any singular noun. For example:
- She has a beautiful ring.
- John has a fast car.
- It has a lovely aroma.

In your sentence, your subject is 'French cooking', which is singular. As such, it is more accurate to use 'has.' 

3. Yes, you answered the question. A corrected version of your response would be: ""For me, French cooking has a unique elegance.""",6,1,1
Do you have any plans for the weekend,Me and my friends are planning go to a concert.,2,Incorrect pronoun usage ('Me' should be 'My friends and I'); infinitive form error ('planning go' should be 'planning to go'),"1. Grammar errors:

- The phrase should start with ""My friends and I"" instead of ""Me and my friends"".
- The verb 'to' is missing before 'go'.

2. Grammar explanations:

- We often use 'me' when it is the object of the verb, while 'I' is used when it is the subject of the verb. In your sentence, you are one of the doers of the action (planning), so, you should use 'I'. Additionally, when there is more than one person including you, you should use ""I"" after mentioning the other people out of politeness. Therefore, instead of ""Me and my friends"", it's more appropriate to say, ""My friends and I"". Example: ""My friends and I are going to watch a movie.""
- The infinitive 'to go' is necessary in this sentence. The base form of the verb 'go' should be preceded by 'to' when expressing purpose or intention. Example: ""I want to go home.""

3. The student does answer the question, albeit with some grammatical errors. A correct and improved version of the student's response would be, ""My friends and I are planning to go to a concert.""",5,1,1
Do you have any plans for the weekend,"This weekend, I playing badminton with my classmates.",1,Verb tense error ('playing' should be 'will play'),"1. The grammar error in this sentence is the incorrect use of the verb form 'playing' after 'I'. 

2. It's great to see you using the continuous tense 'playing', but remember, we need to put 'am' before 'playing' when it comes after 'I'. So, instead of 'I playing', it should be 'I am playing'. 
We put 'am' before continuous verbs (verbs that end in '-ing') when the subject is 'I'. For example, you would say, ""I am running"" not ""I running"". When the subject is 'he', 'she', 'it', or a singular noun, we use 'is' before the verb. For example, ""She is reading"" or ""The bird is flying"". For 'you', 'we', and 'they' or any plural nouns, we use 'are' before the verb. For instance, ""We are playing football"" or ""The children are watching TV"".

3. In your sentence, you've managed to answer the question about your weekend plans, but let's correct the grammar error. A better way to respond would be: ""This weekend, I am playing badminton with my classmates."" Keep up the good work!",4,0,0
What's your favorite movie?,I liked 'Titanic' because it's sad story.,2,Tense inconsistency ('liked' should be 'like' for present preference); missing article ('it's a sad story'),"1. The grammar error is that the indefinite article 'a' is missing before the noun 'story'. 

2. In English, indefinite articles 'a' or 'an' are normally used before singular nouns when the noun is general or unspecified. 'A' is used before words that begin with a consonant sound, and 'an' is used before words that begin with a vowel sound. 
   
   For example, you should say 'a car' instead of 'car' and 'an apple' instead of 'apple' when you are talking about any car or any apple, not a specific one. 

   In your sentence, 'story' is a singular noun, and it is not specified which sad story you are referring to. So, you should use 'a' before 'story'. 

3. You did answer the question about your favorite movie, which is great! A corrected version of your response could be: ""I liked 'Titanic' because it's a sad story.""",3,0,0.5
What's your favorite movie?,I like 'Harry Potter' and I watches them often.,1,subject-verb agreement error ('watches' should be 'watch'),"1. The student has made a grammar error in the sentence.

2. Grammar error:
   The student used the word ""watches"" instead of ""watch"". The word ""watch"" is a verb, and when it is used with the pronoun ""I"", ""you"", ""we"", ""they"", we use ""watch"". ""Watches"" is used when the subject is ""he"", ""she"", or ""it"". 

   - Correct examples include: ""I watch the news every evening"", ""You watch birds at the park"", ""We watch movies on weekends"", ""They watch football on Sunday"". 
   - For 'watches', correct use would be: ""He watches basketball games every Thursday"", ""She watches her cat play in the yard"", ""It watches the house when we're away"". 

3. The student did answer the question, stating their favourite movie is ""Harry Potter"". However, the sentence could be improved to correct the grammar error. Corrected response: ""I like ""Harry Potter"" and I watch them often.""",6,1,1
Where did you go to school?,"In University of Chicago, I have studied anthropology.",2,Prepositional phrase error ('In' should be 'At the'); verb tense error ('have studied' should be 'studied'),"1. The student's response contains a slight grammatical error.
2. The error lies in the usage of the present perfect tense 'have studied' when referring to a completed action in the past. The present perfect tense is typically used to talk about actions that have a connection with the present, or actions that have occurred over an unspecified period of time. For a specific action completed in the past, like graduating from a university, we use past simple tense. 
For example:
- I have lost my keys (Present perfect tense: We use 'have lost' because the action impacts the present moment - I still don't have my keys).
- I lost my keys yesterday (Past simple tense: We use 'lost' because it refers to a specific time in the past).  

Coming back to your sentence, a correct example would be ""I studied anthropology at the University of Chicago"". 
   
3. The student has given a response that answers the question, although their grammar usage is incorrect. The corrected version could be: ""I studied anthropology at the University of Chicago.""",3,0,0.5
Where did you go to school?,I have gone to school at Stanford for studied physics.,3,"Verb tense error ('have gone' should be 'went'); preposition error (""for"" should be ""to""), (""studied"" should be ""study"")","1. The grammar errors in the sentence include: incorrect usage of present perfect tense (""I have gone"") when simple past tense should have been used, and incorrect form of verb following a preposition (""for studied"").

2. Let's clarify the grammar errors:
-  Your use of the present perfect tense ""I have gone"" is typically used for actions that happened at an unspecified time before now. Here, it would be more appropriate to use the simple past tense ""I went"" which is used for completed actions in a time before now. 
Examples:
""I have eaten sushi before."" (Your sushi-eating experience happened at an unspecified time in the past.)
""I went to Japan last year."" (You are referring to a specific time, which was last year, when you went to Japan.)
- Your use of the verb ""studied"" following the preposition ""for"" is incorrect. After prepositions, we use an -ing form of the verb. In this case, ""studying"" would be correct.
Examples: 
""He was late for catching the bus."" (Here, we use ""catching"" after ""for"".)
""She uses this pen for writing letters."" (Again, ""writing"" is used after ""for"".)

3. Yes, you've answered the question, but the grammatical errors might cause some confusion. Here's a corrected and better version: ""I went to Stanford University to study physics.""",2,0,0.33

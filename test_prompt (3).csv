Here are the corrections:

1. ""I wants"" should be ""I want."" 
   Explanation: When the subject is ""I,"" the correct form of the verb ""to want"" is ""want.""
   Example: I want to go to the park.
   Example: She wants to eat dinner.

2. ""it's"" should be ""its."" 
   Explanation: ""It's"" is a contraction of ""it is"" or ""it has."" In this case, you need the possessive form ""its"" to show that the beauty belongs to the buildings.
   Example: The cat licked its paws.
   Example: The tree lost its leaves in the autumn.

3. ""buildings beautiful"" should be ""beautiful buildings.""
   Explanation: When using adjectives to describe nouns in English, the usual order is adjective + noun.

Where do you want to travel to and why?,Me would like to travel to Brazil cause of the beaches.,3,Incorrect pronoun usage ('Me' should be 'I'); informal contraction ('cause' should be 'because'); missing preposition ('of' should be 'because of'),"Your sentence has a minor grammatical issue. It should be: ""I would like to travel to Brazil because of the beaches.""
Errors identified and explanations:
1. Incorrect subject pronoun ""Me"" should be ""I"".
Subject pronoun 'I' is used as the subject of a sentence to refer to oneself. For example, ""I am hungry"" or ""I want to go.""
Another example: ""I would like to eat pizza.""

2. Missing auxiliary verb ""to"" before the verb ""like"".
The correct verb structure is ""would like"" to express a desire or preference.

You effectively answered the question by providing a reason for wanting to travel to Brazil. Great job!",5
What’s your area of expertise?,"My expertise are in cooking and baking, especially cakes.",1,Subject-verb agreement error ('are' should be 'is'),"Your sentence is grammatically correct, well done! However, there's a minor error in the use of the word ""expertise.""

Great job on answering the question effectively!",2
What’s your area of expertise?,My have lots of experience in psychology.,1,Incorrect pronoun usage ('my' should be 'I'),"Your sentence has a minor grammatical issue. It should be: ""I have lots of experience in psychology.""

Errors identified and explanations:

   Example: ""I have lots of experience in psychology.""
2. Missing article before ""psychology"": ""the"" should be used before ""psychology"" to indicate a specific field of study.

What are your hobbies?,I enjoying travel to different countries and watch TV.,2,Gerund form error ('enjoying' should be 'enjoy'); inconsistent verb form ('watch' should be 'watching' for parallelism),"Your sentence has a minor grammatical issue. It should be: ""I enjoy traveling to different countries and watching TV.""
Errors identified and explanations:
1. The verb ""enjoy"" should be in the base form (""enjoy""), not the -ing form (""enjoying""). This is because the infinitive form should be used after the verb ""enjoy.""
Example: I enjoy playing basketball.
2. The verb ""travel"" should be in the -ing form (""traveling"") to match with the verb ""watching"" in the same sentence.
Example: I enjoy traveling to different countries and watching TV.

It should be: ""Pop music is what I enjoy the most.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Verb agreement issue: 
   - The verb ""enjoys"" should be changed to ""enjoy"" to agree with the subject ""I.""

"Okay, let's talk about food! What is your favorite cuisine or dish?",I loves Chinese cuisine.,1,Grammatical Errors:Subject-verb agreement error ('loves' should be 'love'),"Your sentence has a minor grammatical issue. It should be: ""I love Chinese cuisine.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Subject-verb agreement: The verb 'loves' is incorrect because it does not agree with the subject 'I'. Instead, use the verb 'love' to match the singular pronoun 'I'. 

Here are additional examples using 'love' correctly:
- ""I love Italian food.""
- ""She loves Japanese cuisine.""

You have answered the question effectively. Well done!",6
"Okay, let's talk about food!

1. Subject-verb agreement: The verb ""have"" should be changed to ""has"" to agree with the singular subject ""French cooking.""
The correct version of your sentence is: ""For me, French cooking has a unique elegance.""
Examples:
- Incorrect: ""She like ice cream."" (Subject-verb disagreement)

- Correct: ""They like ice cream."" (Subject-verb agreement)

You effectively answered the question. Well done!",5
Do you have any plans for the weekend,Me and my friends are planning go to a concert.,2,Incorrect pronoun usage ('Me' should be 'My friends and I'); infinitive form error ('planning go' should be 'planning to go'),"Your sentence has a minor grammatical issue. It should be: ""My friends and I are planning to go to a concert.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Incorrect subject pronoun usage: You used ""me"" instead of ""I"" as the subject of the sentence.
   ""Me"" is used as the object of a sentence or after prepositions, while ""I"" is used as the subject.
   Example with ""me"": They invited me to the concert.
   Example with ""I"": I am going to the concert.

2. Missing preposition ""to"" before the verb ""go"" to indicate direction.
   Preposition 'to' should be used to indicate direction or destination after ""go"" and before a noun.
   Example: We are planning to go to a concert.

You answered the question effectively. Well done!",6
Do you have any plans for the weekend,"This weekend, I playing badminton with my classmates.",1,Verb tense error ('playing' should be 'will play'),"Your sentence has a minor grammatical error. It should be: ""This weekend, I played badminton with my classmates.""

Error identified and explanation:
You should use the past tense verb ""played"" instead of the present continuous verb ""playing."" Since the activity of playing badminton already happened in the past, the correct tense to use is the simple past.

Good job answering the question and sharing your weekend activity!",6
What’s your favorite movie?,I liked 'Titanic' because it's sad story.,2,Tense inconsistency ('liked' should be 'like' for present preference); missing article ('it's a sad story'),"Your sentence has a minor grammatical issue. It should be: ""I liked 'Titanic' because it's a sad story.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Missing article ""a"" before ""sad story"": 
   The word ""story"" is a countable noun and requires an article before it. In this case, you should use the indefinite article ""a"" before ""sad story"" to show that it is one of many sad stories. Another example is ""I read a good book.""

You effectively answered the question by explaining why you liked 'Titanic.' Great job!",5
What’s your favorite movie?,I like “Harry Potter” and I watches them often.,1,subject-verb agreement error ('watches' should be 'watch'),"Your sentence has a minor grammatical issue. It should be: ""I like 'Harry Potter' and I watch them often.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Verb tense disagreement: The verb 'watches' should be changed to 'watch' to match the subject 'I'. 
- Use 'watch' when referring to activities that are done regularly in the present tense. For example, ""I watch movies every weekend.""
- Use 'watches' when referring to activities done regularly in the present tense by he, she, or it. For example, ""He watches TV every night.""

Additionally, 'Harry Potter' should be written in quotation marks since it is a title of a book or movie. 

You did a great job in answering the question by mentioning your interest in 'Harry Potter'. Keep it up!",6
Where did you go to school?,"In University of Chicago, I have studied anthropology.",2,Prepositional phrase error ('In' should be 'At the'); verb tense error ('have studied' should be 'studied'),"Your sentence is grammatically correct, keep up the good work!",0
Where did you go to school?,I have gone to school at Stanford for studied physics.,2,Verb tense error ('have gone' should be 'went'); gerund form error ('studied' should be 'studying'),"Your sentence has a few grammar mistakes. Here's the corrected version: ""I went to Stanford University to study physics.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Use of present perfect tense ""have gone"" instead of simple past tense ""went"". 
   - The present perfect tense is used to indicate an action that started in the past and has a connection to the present, while the simple past tense is used to describe a completed action in the past. In this case, the action of going to school at Stanford is a completed action in the past, so the simple past tense ""went"" should be used.

2. Incorrect placement of preposition ""for"" after ""school"" instead of before ""studied"". 
   - The preposition ""for"" should be used before ""studied"" to indicate the purpose or reason for going to school. 

Here are additional examples that correctly use both the incorrect word and the appropriate word:

- Incorrect: ""I is hungry."" → Correct: ""I am hungry.""
- Incorrect: ""She have a dog."" → Correct: ""She has a dog.""
- Incorrect: ""They is going to the park."" → Correct: ""They are going to the park.""",3

Where can I get this book?,I can get this book from that library.,0,,"Your sentence is grammatically correct, keep up the good work!",6
Where can I get this book?,This book is at store can be find.,3,"Sentence structure error, missing article, ""can be find"" should be ""can be found"" (verb tense error)","Your sentence has some grammatical errors. Here's the corrected version: ""This book can be found at the store.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Incorrect word order: ""can be find"" should be replaced with ""can be found."" 
   In passive voice sentences, the verb ""be"" is always followed by the past participle form of the verb (e.g., found). 
   Example: ""The keys were found by the door.""

2. Missing article: ""at store"" should be changed to ""at the store."" 
   ""The"" is used before singular or plural nouns to refer to a specific person, place, or thing. 
   Example: ""I bought a shirt at the store.""

3. Incorrect word usage: ""is"" should be replaced with ""find."" 
   This change ensures the sentence is in the correct tense.
   Example: ""This book can be found at the library.""

Your sentence is almost complete, but it would be more effective if you provide a reason or explanation for why the book can be found at the store.",6
Where can I get this book?,Maybe book are in shop near you.,2,"""Book are"" should be ""the book is"" (subject-verb agreement and missing article), ""shop"" should be ""a shop"" or ""the shop"" (missing article)","Your sentence has a minor grammatical issue. It should be: ""Maybe books are in a shop near you.""
Errors identified and explanations:
1. Incorrect verb agreement: 'book' should be pluralized to 'books' to agree with the verb 'are.'
2. Missing article: 'a' should be used before 'shop' to indicate a general, unspecified shop.
3. Missing preposition: 'near' should be followed by 'you' to indicate location.

Another example using 'book' correctly: ""Maybe a book is on the shelf at the library.""
Another example using 'are' correctly: ""Maybe the cats are playing in the garden.""

What is your favorite animal?,My favorite animals is cats because they're very funnies.,3,"""Animals is"" should be ""animal is"" (subject-verb agreement error), ""cats"" should be ""the cat"" or ""cats"" (inconsistent pluralization), ""funnies"" should be ""funny"" (incorrect adjective form)","There are a few grammar errors in your response. Here's the corrected version of your sentence: ""My favorite animals are cats because they're very funny.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Subject-verb agreement: ""is"" should be corrected to ""are"".
   In this case, ""animals"" is the subject of the sentence and it is plural, so the verb should also be plural. Example: ""My favorite animal is a cat"" (singular), ""My favorite animals are cats"" (plural).

2. Spelling error: ""funnies"" should be corrected to ""funny"".
   Here, ""funny"" is the correct spelling. Example: ""They're very funny"" (correct).

Overall, great job answering the question and explaining why you like cats!",5
What is your favorite animal?,Dogs is best animal for me because they is loyal.,3,"""Dogs is"" should be ""Dogs are"" (subject-verb agreement error), ""they is"" should be ""they are"" (subject-verb agreement error), ""best animal"" should be ""the best animal"" (missing article)","Your sentence has a few grammar errors. Here are the corrections:

1. ""Dogs"" should be changed to ""Dogs are"" to match the plural subject.
- Use ""are"" instead of ""is"" when referring to plural subjects like ""dogs.""

Examples:
- Dogs are playful.
- Dogs are friendly.

2. ""They is loyal"" should be changed to ""They are loyal.""
- Use ""are"" instead of ""is"" when referring to plural subjects like ""they.""

Here's the corrected version:

""I chose the red color because it is bright and beautiful.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Verb tense error: ""chooses"" should be corrected to ""chose."" 
   - ""Chose"" is the past tense of the verb ""choose"" and is used when referring to a specific action that occurred in the past. For example, ""I chose a book to read yesterday.""
   - ""Chooses"" is the present tense of the verb ""choose"" and is used when referring to a habitual or ongoing action. For example, ""He chooses to eat healthy every day.""

2. Missing article: ""the"" should be added before ""red color."" 
   - When referring to a specific color, we use the article ""the"" before the color. For example, ""I chose the red color for the painting.""

3. Missing helping verb: ""is"" should be added before ""bright and beautiful."" 
   - We use the helping verb ""is"" to connect the subject ""it"" and the adjectives ""bright"" and ""beautiful."" For example, ""The flower is bright and beautiful.""

Overall, you answered the question effectively by explaining why you chose the color red. Well done!",6
What color will you choose to be your dress?,Blue is the color I choosing for it's calmness.,2,"""I choosing"" should be ""I am choosing"" (verb tense error), ""it's"" should be ""its"" (possessive pronoun error)","Your sentence has a few minor grammatical issues. Here's the corrected version: ""Blue is the color I am choosing for its calmness.""

Errors identified and explanations:
1. Incorrect verb form: Instead of using the present continuous tense ""I choosing,"" you should use the present continuous tense ""I am choosing."" It is used to talk about actions happening now or in the near future. 

Example: ""I am choosing a book to read.""

2. Incorrect use of apostrophe: ""it's"" is a contraction of ""it is"" or ""it has."" In this context, you should use the possessive form ""its"" to indicate ownership.

Example: ""The book has its cover.""

3. Missing article: You need to use the article ""the"" before the noun ""color"" to specify which color you are referring to.

Example: ""Blue is the color of the sky.""

   - Correct: My decision for choosing this major was...

You effectively answered the question. Well done!",5
Why do you choose this major?,I chooses this major because I loving science and it's interesting for me.,3,"""Chooses"" should be ""chose"" (verb tense error), ""loving"" should be ""love"" (verb tense error), ""it's interesting for me"" is awkward; better phrasing would be ""it interests me"" (awkward phrasing)","Your sentence has a few grammar and spelling errors. Here are the identified errors and their corrections:

1. Verb agreement error: ""I chooses"" should be corrected to ""I chose"" or ""I choose"" depending on the tense you want to use.
   - ""I chose"" is the past tense of ""choose"" and is used when referring to a decision made in the past.
   - ""I choose"" is the present tense and is used when referring to a decision being made in the present.
   Examples:

It should be: ""I want to do this project because it's giving me many learnings.""
